  <b>An exercise in function programming in JavaScript</b>
</p>

## Description
This is a simple dashboard-like application that consumes the [NASA Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/).  
After selecting a rover, users can see some data about a rover and its mission and the most recent images it took.  
The main aim of this application was playing around with pure functions and functional concepts in JavaScript.
